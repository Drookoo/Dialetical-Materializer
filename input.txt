Full of a baby's venom. The women in the house knew it and so did the children. For years each put
up with the spite in his own way, but by 1873 Sethe and her daughter Denver were its only victims. The grandmother,
Baby Suggs, was dead, and the sons, Howard and Buglar, had run away by the time they were thirteen years old--as soon
as merely looking in a mirror shattered it (that was the signal for Buglar); as soon as two tiny hand prints appeared in the
cake (that was it for Howard). Neither boy waited to see more; another kettleful of chickpeas smoking in a heap on the
floor; soda crackers crumbled and strewn in a line next to the door sill. Nor did they wait for one of the relief periods:
the weeks, months even, when nothing was disturbed. No. Each one fled at once--the moment the house committed
what was for him the one insult not to be borne or witnessed a second time. Within two months, in the dead of winter,
leaving their grandmother, Baby Suggs; Sethe, their mother; and their little sister, Denver, all by themselves in the gray
and white house on Bluestone Road. It didn't have a number then, because Cincinnati didn't stretch that far. In fact,
Ohio had been calling itself a state only seventy years when first one brother and then the next stuffed quilt packing into
his hat, snatched up his shoes, and crept away from the lively spite the house felt for them.
Baby Suggs didn't even raise her head. From her sickbed she heard them go but that wasn't the reason she lay still. It
was a wonder to her that her grandsons had taken so long to realize that every house wasn't like the one on Bluestone
Road. Suspended between the nas tiness of life and the meanness of the dead, she couldn't get interested in leaving life
or living it, let alone the fright of two creeping-off boys. Her past had been like her present--intolerable--and since she
knew death was anything but forgetfulness, she used the little energy left her for pondering color.
